# What is the Falcon project?

Falcon decompiles boot0, boot1, boot2, and the Wii system menu in C for the sake of reverse engineering. Falcon can compile on almost any modern system (and by modern we mean at least 32-bit should work fine).&#x20;

Additionally, I've written some stuff regarding the Wii's hardware, which can be found [here](https://app.gitbook.com/o/UdGPI1ah4zaCsAxMuWw9/s/qnSqiIyIGyhnCPG9jcKr/).
